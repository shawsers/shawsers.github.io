April 8, 2021 - My latest certification: [Scrum Fundamentals Certified!](https://www.scrumstudy.com/certification/verify?type=SFC&number=838678)
Took only a few days of studying, and wasn't that hard overall.  Nice way to get back into studying after about a month off after my last few Azure exams.

Next up is Rancher and Terraform Associate....
