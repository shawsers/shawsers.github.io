May 11, 2020 - This was the start of my journey into writing exams again.  It has been many years since I studied for and actually wrote the exam.  The motivation for me was partially that I had a free exam voucher, but I also wanted to show and experience in Azure by actually getting certified.  I took the time, studied more than I needed to and passed the [Azure Fundamentals exam with over 90%!](https://www.credly.com/badges/5e3acbf5-38cf-4cb7-970e-1fa864e4c0b1)

April 8, 2021 - My latest certification: [Scrum Fundamentals Certified!](https://www.scrumstudy.com/certification/verify?type=SFC&number=838678)
Took only a few days of studying, and wasn't that hard overall.  Nice way to get back into studying after about a month off after my last few Azure exams.

Next up is Rancher and Terraform Associate....
