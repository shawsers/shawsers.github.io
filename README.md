Hi everyone, below I would like to share my experience in 2020 and 2021 and writing IT exams again after many years!

**May 11, 2020** - This was the start of my journey into writing exams again.  It has been many years since I studied for and actually wrote the exam.  The motivation for me was partially that I had a free exam voucher, but I also wanted to show and experience in Azure by actually getting certified.  I took the time, studied more than I needed to and passed the [Azure Fundamentals exam with over 90%!](https://www.credly.com/badges/5e3acbf5-38cf-4cb7-970e-1fa864e4c0b1)

**December 18, 2020** - I thought I would have wrote this exam much sooner than I did, as I was studied up in July, but felt I wasn't properly prepared and decided to wait until after the summer.  Sure enough summer went and into late fall I decided to start studying again and along came the "Get AWS Certified Global Challege" as part of AWS re:Invent so I decided to take part in that challenge and ended up passing the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam](https://www.credly.com/badges/25131d43-02be-43a5-8088-846fd9951338) just before the Christmas break!  It was a nice way to end the year for me, getting two entry level Cloud certs.

**January 15, 2021** - I jumped right back into studying after the Christmas break and decided to focus on Azure, starting with the Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104).  I remembered that I had 3 exam vouchers from all of the online/virtual conferences I attended over the past year during covid, I figured why not give it my best shot, go head down studying for 2 solid weeks. This meant getting up at 5am everyday, watching training videos for 2 hours, working until noon, study again for 1 hour during lunch, work until 5pm, then right back into studying for another 2 - 4 hours each night watching videos and doing labs.  I have been using Azure for many years at this point, so I wasn't learning from scratch by any means, but I wanted to make sure I was well prepared for the exam as I knew this was was much longer and a lot more technical in detail. I went into the exam feeling very well prepared and passed the exam and was a great way to start the year, becoming an [Azure Administrator Associate!](https://www.credly.com/badges/2a409d50-b51f-47e8-84d5-0e5b0433e9cd)

**February 1, 2021** - So I decided to keep the studying train going since it worked so well and attempt the Azure Architect Technologies (AZ-303) exam.  I continued to get up early to study, during my lunch break and every evening.  What I found was that there is a lot of overlap in content between the AZ-104 and AZ-303 exams, so the studying wasn't as intense as I thought it was going to be and I am glad I went right into studying for AZ-303.  I still went heads down for 2 solid weeks and again I had a free exam voucher and felt I had nothing to loose.  But looking at the exam guide and how long the exam was I felt a little bit stressed going into the exam as I have never sat for an exam that long.  All in all it took me over 2 hours to take the exam, as I took my time before moving on to the next question.  In the end it worked for me and I was super excited to find out that [I passed the Azure Architect Technologies exam!](https://www.credly.com/badges/3e1fe1b1-2b87-4144-b872-a0c9da91b3aa)

**February 22, 2021** - Now that I was really on a role and passed two exams in one month, I figured I had nothing to loose to at least try to pass AZ-304 to become an Azure Certified Solution Architect Expert, especially that I had one exam voucher left.  So I started studying but not as extreme as the last two exams and figured I would give my self a solid three weeks of studying instead of two.  Studying for AZ-304 again had some overlap from both AZ-104 and AZ-303, so it made it a little easier to study overall but had to dig into a few areas that were not covered in the other two exams and also from a design perspective.  This exam was the most stressed I have been sitting for an exam, knowing it was the last chance I had with my voucher but also knowing how far I have come and the amount of studying I had put in, the time away from family to study but how much support they have given me over the past few months.  But I was happy to find out in the end after almost the full 3 hours in the exam I PASSED!!  I have never been so excited and happy with passing an exam!!  [Passing the AZ-304 Azure Architect Design exam](https://www.credly.com/badges/01bdcfd6-7d24-4603-b76f-4476a1cfc54d) in combination with the AZ-303 above I am now officially a [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert!!](https://www.credly.com/badges/d4658cb6-9307-4799-979a-5d995198c43e).  This is one certification I thought I would never have, but am so excited and happy about getting it and now able to share this with everyone and to actually use what I learned in my career!  Now time to relax and take a much needed break from studying for a while...

**April 8, 2021** - I decided to finally take the Scrum Fundamentals exam, as I have studied for it many years ago but never wrote the free exam.  It took only a few days of studying, and wasn't that hard overall.  It was a nice way to get back into studying after a few months off after writing my last Azure exam.  I am now [Scrum Fundamentals Certified!](https://www.scrumstudy.com/certification/verify?type=SFC&number=838678)


**June 9, 2021** - I decided to attempt the Gremlin Certified Chaos Engineering Practitioner exam as I was looking on LinkedIn and found that Gremlin was offering this new exam for free for a limited time.  I learned about Gremlin and their Chaos Engineering from one of the virtual conferences I attended and really liked the concept and wanted to learn more.  I studied for a few days and attempted the exam and sure enough I was able to [pass the exam to earn this certification!](https://www.credential.net/899958b7-8a62-4d68-9e46-22a4b25d101b#gs.8dku72).  Pretty cool as now I am a certified Gremlin and I got the shirt to prove it!!

My long term plan is the following paid courses and exams (in no particular order), after the two above...
